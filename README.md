# Apple-Store
Apple Store web application created using Python (Django Framework) 
To run this application you must clone this project to C:\Project\ and rename the folder name as env

This app can be used for the reference to learn django and implement many things using this framework. 
This project uses Django user authentication which allows you to keep sessions and check if you are logged in or not if you are already logged in then it allows you to logout 
if you are not logged in then it allows you to create new user. As user you can view all the products and you can buy product using your card detail but payment works only when you are logged in
Just by using annotation this feature has been implemented.

Administrator allows you to add products, see order list, product list, user list and it allows you to add new users as well as admin user. 
Each product contain its title, desciption, price and other features. Each user can have their own picture in their profile and they can edit thier profile as well. 
This app runs smoothly without any error. If you find any bug you can comment down below or you can commit changes if you can solve it. I would happly accept it. 

Thanks for using this app. :)
